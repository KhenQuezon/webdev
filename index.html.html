    <p>Hi, my name is Khen Aldrich Quezon, I'm 18 years old and currently living in my aunt's
           house at Labangon Optima, being able to go to college is already a big blessing for me,
           but deciding what course I should take was one of the challenging part of going to college, 
           because most of my family asks me "Why did you chose the course BSIT?" it hits me everytime 
           they question me about my course, and my answer is always "no choice" or "hilig man kos computer"
           but deep inside, I have my own reason that I can't even comprehend because of the pressure in the
           family and to other people. This course was my second opinion next to Psychology, IT is the only 
           course that my family approved and due to financial reasons, but deep inside, I really want to
           pursue this course because I can see myself as a developer in the future and i know this cours
           e will challenge my critical thinking skills, being patient, and many more to uncover. I promise 
           to myself and to my family that I will do everything that I can to finish my academics, because
           I want to repay all the kindness and love that they have given to me. I know reaching my goals
           are not easy as dreaming of it, but all and all I will do my very best to reach the end of this
           chapter and make my family proud of what i will achieve.</p>
